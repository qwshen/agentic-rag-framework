This (Agentic) RAG Framework is a configurable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to simplify the construction, orchestration, and execution of advanced RAG pipelines. Built on LangChain 1.0.5 (requiring Python 3.10+), the framework provides a structured, extensible foundation for applications that demand accurate, grounded, and high-quality responses powered by external knowledge.

This framework enables developers to build robust RAG workflows using declarative configuration rather than custom code. By integrating retrieval, reasoning, and LLM-based decision-making, the system supports adaptive and agent-like behaviors—known as agentic RAG. This makes question answering more reliable, interpretable, and context-aware.

#### **Key Functionalities**

- **Config-Driven Pipeline Construction** - Build RAG chains declaratively through JSON configuration, enabling reusable and environment-independent setups.
- **Agentic Reasoning Capabilities** - Incorporates LLM-based reasoning steps such as query rewriting, document grading, and answer grounding to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
- **Flexible Retrieval Layer** - Supports multiple vector stores, hybrid retrieval, and custom retrievers
- **Document Grading & Filtering** - Dynamically evaluates retrieved documents for relevance and quality before passing them to the answer synthesis stage.
- **Answer Grounding** - Ensures generated answers are supported by the retrieved evidence, improving factual reliability.
- **Session-Aware Query Understanding** - Optional chat-history reasoning via session-based memory integration.

There are two major phases in typical RAG pipelines - Document Indexing and Answer Generation. The following diagram describes its components and process flow:
